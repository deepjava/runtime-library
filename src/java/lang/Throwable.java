/**
 * The superclass of all classes which can be thrown by the VM. The
 * two direct subclasses are recoverable exceptions ({@code Exception}) and
 * unrecoverable errors ({@code Error}). This class provides common methods for
 * accessing a string message which provides extra information about the
 * circumstances in which the {@code Throwable} was created (basically an error
 * message in most cases), and for saving a stack trace (that is, a record of
 * the call stack at a particular point in time) which can be printed later.
 *
 * <p>A {@code Throwable} can also include a cause, which is a nested {@code
 * Throwable} that represents the original problem that led to this {@code
 * Throwable}. It is often used for wrapping various types of errors into a
 * common {@code Throwable} without losing the detailed original error
 * information. When printing the stack trace, the trace of the cause is
 * included.
 *
 * @see Error
 * @see Exception
 * @see RuntimeException
